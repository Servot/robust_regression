# Soft Robust Statistics
This repository contains the code for the paper [Smart initialisation and approximating loss function for robust regression](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2023.119715).

All the plots in the paper are generated by running the notebook [Soft_LTS - Paper plots.ipynb](./Soft_LTS%20-%20Paper%20plots.ipynb).

Dependencies are specified in [environments.yml](./environment.yml). 
The `r2py` dependency requires an installation of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/). It is also assumed that the r-dependency [robustbase](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/robustbase/index.html) is installed.

Datasets are publicly available and are assumed to be downloaded as `.txt`-files. The [Experiment class](./experiment.py) accepts a datapath argument that specifies to datafolder and file extension.
